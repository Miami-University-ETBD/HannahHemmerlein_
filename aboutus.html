        <h1>Our Promise</h1>
        <p>At <strong>Heritage Crafts,</strong> we believe that great design doesn’t just look good—<i>it tells a story.</i> Founded in New York City, our pottery shop began with a simple vision: to create handcrafted pieces that merge timeless artistry with modern design. What started as a small passion project has grown into a full-fledged business, fueled by a love for craftsmanship and the desire to create unique, enduring pieces for homes everywhere. Each item is hand-touched by our skilled artisans, ensuring every curve, texture, and glaze speaks to the beauty of individuality.</p>

        <p>Our collection is for anyone who values quality, authenticity, and the artistry behind everyday objects. Whether you're in the heart of the city or beyond, our pottery is designed to fit seamlessly into any space. From carefully crafted vases to statement bowls, every piece is more than just decor—it’s a piece of heritage, made for today and tomorrow.
